# Tegra Linux
This project is a fork of the grate-driver project that aims to create slim and optimized kernels for different Nvidia Tegra based devices. This project aims to further optimize kernels by removing unnecessary drivers, compiling kernels with optimized parameters, and providing device specific configuration files.

# Devices

## Supported
You can follow the build steps in each device's branch to build it's optimized kernel. Automated prebuilt kernels will be added in the future. The following devices are fully supported:
- Microsoft Surface RT (surface-rt)

## Planned
- Nintendo Switch
- Nvidia Shield Portable
